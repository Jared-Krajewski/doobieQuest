# DoobieQuest: Game Concept

DoobieQuest is a side scrolling mario adventure game with a stoner theme. The player explores a series of interconnected rooms and levels, collecting items, fighting enemies, and overcoming hazards to complete their quest.

## Core Concepts

- **Top-Down Exploration:**
  - The game is played from a top-down perspective, with the player moving freely in all directions.
  - The world is divided into 3 levels, each with 3 rooms (9 rooms total), with doors connecting rooms horizontally.

- **Progression Structure:**
  - Each level represents a different environment:
    1. **The Crib:** A stoner's house, with obstacles like couches and tables, and hazards like cockroaches and spilled milk.
    2. **Convenience Store:** Maze-like shelving, clerk NPC, and hazards like water puddles and spills.
    3. **Back Alley:** Gritty alley with rats, dumpsters, garbage juice, and the dealer NPC.
  - The player must progress through all rooms in each level to advance.

- **Randomization:**
  - The placement of obstacles, hazards, money, and enemies is randomized in each room.
  - Key items (lighter, clerk, dealer) spawn in random rooms/locations within their respective levels.

- **Combat & Hazards:**
  - The player can attack in four directions and throw a bong as a projectile.
  - Enemies (roamers and shooters) patrol rooms and attack the player.
  - Hazards (moving and static) deal damage on contact.
  - All enemies take 2 hits to defeat.

- **Doors & Room Transitions:**
  - Doors connect rooms and are placed at the edges of the map.
  - Door transitions have a cooldown to prevent spam and always respawn the player at the entry door.

- **Quest Items & Victory:**
  - The player must find a lighter (in the crib), buy papers from the clerk (in the store), and buy weed from the dealer (in the alley).
  - Once all items are collected, the player can smoke the joint to win the game.

- **HUD & Controls:**
  - On-screen HUD displays hearts (health), lives, money, collected items, and mission objectives.
  - Controls: WASD/arrows to move, SPACE to attack, SHIFT to throw bong, E to interact, Q to smoke.

- **Visuals & Theming:**
  - Each level has a distinct look and obstacles/hazards that match the environment.
  - The game is designed to be humorous and lighthearted, with a stoner vibe throughout.
